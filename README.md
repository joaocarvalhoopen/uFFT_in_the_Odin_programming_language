# uFFT in the Odin programming language
A port of the uFFT library from C to the Odin programming language.

## Description
uFFT in Odin is a small portable Odin library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in one dimension. <br>

It's a port of the original uFFT from C. <br>

Implements also Convolution, Cross-Correlation and Auto-Correlation. <br>

The library implements forward and inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms using both decimation in time (DIT) and decimation in frequency (DIF). <br>

The library is written in pure C99. No compiler extensions nor assembly language are employed. It uses floating point data type and can handle unaligned data. <br>
The FFT routines can be easily modified since their source code has less than a hundred lines. As you might expect, the uFFT performance does not outperform the performance of FFTW. The library uses one temporary array as large as the input array. <br>

This library uses f32 and complex64 types from the Odin standard library.
